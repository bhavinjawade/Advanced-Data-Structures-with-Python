# Advanced Data Structures with Python

This repository contains Data structures, Algorithms and their common usecases implemented by me in python. This repository is really helpful for those, who prefer to do competitive programming in python. 

## Contents:

> Click on "Code" to see code of that data structure or algorithm, and click on "Learn" to read markdown.

### Algorithms-

* Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm (Java + Python) [Code](DijkstraShortestReach.py)
* Kahn's Algorithm for Topological Sort [Code](Kahns_Algo_Topologicalsort.py) [Learn](Kahns_Algo_Topologicalsort.md)
* Depth First Search [Code](DFS.py)
* Floyd Warshall Algorithm [Code](Floyd_Warshall_Algorithm.py) [Learn](Floyd_Warshall_Algorithm.md)
* Longest Common Subsequence (Java) [Code](LongestCommonSubsequence.java)
* Longest Common Substring (Java) [Code](LongestCommonSubstring.java)

### Data Structures-
* Trie Data Structure [Code](Trie_Data_Structure.py) [Learn](Trie_Data_Structure.md) 
* Segment Tree (For sum) (Java + Python)   [Code](segment_Tree.py)
* Union Find Data Structures (Disjoint Set Data Structure) [Code](UnionFindDS.py)
* Binary Search Tree [Code](BST.py)

## Learning Python ( the pythonic way)

Lambdas <br>
```python
lambda arguments : expression
```

List Comprehensions <br>
```python
number_list = [ x for x in range(20) if x % 2 == 0]
```

Class <br>
```python
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

p1 = Person("John", 36)

print(p1.name)
print(p1.age)
```
Map <br>
```python
map(function_object, iterable1, iterable2,...)
```

filter <br>
```python
filter(function_object, iterable)
```
## Python Tricks

Input Space Separated Integers as List<br>
```python
numbers = list(map(int, input().split()))
```
